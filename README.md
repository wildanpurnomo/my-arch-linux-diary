# What
My personal diary on learning, installing and using Arch. I still don't believe I managed to install Arch. I used to took 2-3 years to even understand what JSON is.

# Table of contents
Each chapter will be done in different branches:
- Intro: Why and Should I?
- Yet Another Arch Installation Guide. But this time I'll also cover what typically differ in some tutorials and discuss the differences.
- After Story: DE (Desktop Environment)
- After Story: Gaming
- After Story: Maintenance
